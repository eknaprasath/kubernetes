What is kubernetes?

   Kubernetes is a tool for automated management of containerized applications, 
   also known as a container orchestration tool.
   More detail: https://kubernetes.io/
   
   Automate your application infrastructure and make it easy to manage
   
What are containers?

   Kubernetes is all about managing containers
   
   Containers wrap software in independent, portable packages, making it easy
   to quickly run software in a variety of environment. when you wrap your software
   in a container, you can quickly and easily run it anywhere. that makes containers great for automation.
   
   containers are a bit like VM, but they are smaller and start up faster. this means that 
   automation can move quickly and efficiently with containers
   
   
Orchestration

   With containers, you can run a variety of software components across a cluster of generic servers.
   
   This can help ensure high availability and make it easier to scale resources.
   
   This raises some questions:
     . How can i ensure that multiple instances of a piece of software are apread across
       multiple servers for high availability
     .  How can I deploy new code changes and roll them out across the entire cluster?
     . How can i create new containers to handle additional load ( scale up )?
     
     of course, these kinds of tasks can all be done manually , but that is a lot of work
     
     The answer is to use an orchestration tool to automate these kinds of management tasks.
     That is what kubernetes done.

Installing Docker:

Add the Docker Repository GPG key:
   
  curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

Add the docker repository:

sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"

Reload the apt sources list:
sudo apt-get update

Install Docker:
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce=18.06.1~ce~3-0~ubuntu

Prevent auto-updates for the docker package:
sudo apt-mark hold docker-ce
You can verify that docker is working by running this command:

sudo docker version



the process of installing Kubeadm, Kubelet, and Kubectl on all three servers.

Kubeadm: This is a tool which automates a large portion of the process of setting
         up a cluster. it will make our job much easier
Kubelet:  The essential component of kubernetes
curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

cat << EOF | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main
EOF

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install -y kubelet=1.12.7-00 kubeadm=1.12.7-00 kubectl=1.12.7-00

sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl

After installing these components, verify that Kubeadm is working by getting the version info.

kubeadm version
