Components

API Server - will act as frontend for k8s ( users, management devices, cli all talk to API Server to interact with Kubernetes cluster)
etcd  - Distributed reliable Key-value store used by k8s to store data to manage the cluster. When we have multiple nodes and multiple masters
         in your cluster etcd store all the information in all the nodes in the cluster in the distributed manner, etcd is responsible for
		 implementing locks within the cluster to ensure that ther is no conflicts between masters 
Kubelet -  And finally kubelet is the agent that runs on each node in the cluster. The agent is
			responsible for making sure that the containers are running on the nodes as
			expected.
Container Runtime  - The container runtime is the underlying software that is used to run containers. In our
          case it happens to be Docker. 
Controller  - The controllers are the brain behind orchestration. They are responsible for noticing
				and responding when nodes, containers or endpoints goes down. The controllers
				makes decisions to bring up new containers in such cases.

Scheduler  - The scheduler is responsible for distributing work or containers across multiple
				nodes. It looks for newly created containers and assigns them to Nodes.
