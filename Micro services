MICROSERVICES

  One of the best ways to demonstrate the value of kubernetes is in managing microservice applications.
  
  Microservices are small,, independent services that work together to form a whole applicaiton.
  
  Many applications are designed with a monolithic architecture, meaning that all parts of the applicaitons are
  combined in one large executable
  
  MONOLITH APPLICATION
  
  AUTH
  PRODUCT DATA
  SEARCH CUSTOMER DATA
  
  Microservice architectures break the application up into several small services
  
  Microservice Applicaiton
  
  Auth  Customer data   Product data   Search
                        Product data   Search
                                       Search
                                       Search
                                       
                                       
   Here are a few advantages of microservices:
   
    . Scalability: Indivirual microservices are independently scalable. If your search service
       is under a large amount of load, you can scale that service by itself, without scaling the whole application.
       
    . Cleaner Code: When services are relatively independent, it is easier to make a change in one area of application
      without breaking things in other areas.
      
    . Reliaility: Problems in one area of the application are less likely to affect other areas.
    
    . Variety of tools: Different parts of the application can be built using different tools, languages, and 
      frameworks, This means that the right tools can be used for every job!
      
      
   Implementing microservices means deploying, scaling and managing a lot of individual components! Kubernetes is a 
   great tool for accomplishing all of this. in the world of microservies, the benefits of kubernetes really shine!
